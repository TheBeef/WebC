 *
 * SYNOPSIS:
 *    bool FS_GetFileProperties(const char *Filename,
 *          struct WSPageProp *PageProp);
 *
 * PARAMETERS:
 *    Filename [I] -- The filename from the URL that is being requested.
 *    PageProp [O] -- This is filled in with info about the page.
 *                      FileID -- The ID of the page.  This has no meaning
 *                                to the web server it is just passed back
 *                                to FS_SendFile().  It can hold a pointer.
 *                      DynamicFile -- If this is true then the file will
 *                                     no be cached.  false will set the
 *                                     ETAG to 'DOCVER' where it will not
 *                                     resent to the browser until 'DOCVER'
 *                                     changes.
 *                      Cookies -- A pointer to the list of cookies that this
 *                                 page accepts.
 *                      Gets -- A pointer to the list of GET vars that this
 *                              page accepts.
 *                      Posts -- A pointer to the list of POST vars that this
 *                               page accepts.
 *
 * FUNCTION:
 *    This function is called when a new request comes in for a file.  This
 *    is before the headers for this request have been processed and the
 *    web server is not yet ready to send a reply.
 *
 *    The web server does need to know if this is a valid file and some info
 *    about the file.  That is what this function provides.
 *
 * RETURNS:
 *    true -- File known and can be sent
 *    false -- File is known.  Will produce a 404 reply.
 *
 * SEE ALSO:
 *    FS_SendFile()
